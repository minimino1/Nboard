Nboard v1.0.1 - Bugfix Release

Nboard is a Nothing-inspired Android keyboard with AI tools, smart clipboard, emoji search, and minimalist UX.

This update focuses on stability and typing flow fixes from v1.0.0.

Fixed
- Fixed a crash when deleting clipboard history items.
- Fixed emoji search selection to insert into the active app input field (not the search bar).
- Fixed prompt/search focus routing so typing can return to the host app text field instead of staying locked to the inline pill input.
- Added a new `Disabled` option for Basic autocorrect in Settings.

Core Features (unchanged)
- AI Integration (Gemini): Summarize, Fix Grammar, Expand, custom prompts.
- Smart Clipboard: history, pin/delete, recent clipboard chip.
- Typing & Input: AZERTY/QWERTY, smart shift, long-press variants, spacebar cursor swipe.
- Emoji & Search: searchable emoji browser with recent usage.
- Customization: themes, fonts, configurable side mode keys.
- Beta Features: Swipe Typing and Word Prediction.
