## Project Status

Nboard is **feature-complete** and in maintenance mode after v1.1.0.

I built this keyboard to solve my own problem: wanting a Nothing-inspired keyboard with AI tools. It works great, and I use it daily.

I'll fix critical bugs, but I'm not committing to major new features. The project does what it's meant to do.

If you want additional features, fork it! It's open source (AGPL-3.0) for exactly this reason.
